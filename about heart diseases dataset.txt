# Sex
(1 = male, 0 = female)

# Chest pain type
(Scale 1 - 4)
1->Heart-related chest pain
2->Unusual heart pain
3->Chest pain not related to the heart
4->No chest pain at all

# BP (mm Hg)
(Resting blood pressure from 94 - 200)
Measures how strongly blood pushes against artery walls,
High blood pressure means the heart is working harder.
->94 mm Hg → Normal / low-normal
->120–139 mm Hg → High
->140–200 mm Hg → Very high / dangerous

# Cholesterol (mg/dl)
(Cholesterol Level from 126 - 564)
Measures fat in the blood,
Too much cholesterol can block blood flow to the heart.
-> < 200 Normal
-> 200 – 239 Borderline high
-> ≥ 240 High
-> ≥ 300	Very dangerous

# FBS over 120 (mg/dl)
(Fasting Blood Sugar 1 = Yes, 0 = No)
Checks blood sugar level after fasting
->1 = High sugar
->0 = Normal sugar
High sugar can damage blood vessels

# EKG (Electrokardiogram) results
(Resting electrocardiogram results from 0 - 2)
EKG/ECG is an Heart electricity test.
What each value means
0 = Normal
-> Heart’s electrical activity is normal
-> Heart is beating properly
1 = Slight problem
-> Heart signals are a bit abnormal
-> May show stress or minor heart issues
2 = Bigger problem
-> Heart muscle is thicker or enlarged
-> Heart has to work harder than normal

# Max HR
(Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise from 71 - 202)
The fastest the heart beats during exercise
A healthy heart can beat faster when needed
Resting heart rate: ~60–100 bpm
-> < 100 Too low (possible problem)
-> 100 – 140 Okay / average
-> 140 – 190 Good (depends on age)      

# Exercise angina
(1 = Yes, 0 = No)
Chest pain during exercise,
Means the heart may not be getting enough oxygen.

# ST depression
(ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest from 0 - 6.2)
ST depression is a number doctors get from an ECG/EKG test during exercise (stress test),
It shows how much the heart is struggling to get enough oxygen when you exercise.
-> 0 – 1 → Normal / no stress on the heart
-> 1 – 2 → Mild problem
-> > 2 → Serious heart stress

# Slope of ST
( from 1 - 3)
This describes how the heart’s ECG line behaves during exercise.
1 = Upward slope
-> Heart is responding normally
-> Best / healthy sign
2 = Flat slope
-> Heart may not be getting enough oxygen
-> Warning sign
3 = Downward slope
-> Strong sign of heart stress
-> Most dangerous
Higher number = worse condition.

# Number of vessel 
( from 0 - 3)
Shows how many major blood vessels are blocked or damaged.
-> 0 → No blocked vessels (healthy)
-> 1 → One vessel blocked
-> 2 → Two vessels blocked
-> 3 → Three vessels blocked (very serious)
More vessels = more severe heart disease

# Thallium
( from 3 - 7)
This is a special heart scan where a radioactive dye called thallium is injected.
It shows how well blood flows to the heart muscle, especially during exercise.
Blood flow quality.
-> 3 = Normal → All pipes deliver water fine
-> 6 = Fixed defect → Some pipes are broken permanently → plants always get less water
-> 7 = Reversible defect → Some pipes clog only when water demand is high → plants dry out during stress but fine later

#(String) Heart Disease
It's the Final Diagnosis 
-> 0 =>Absence 56% 
-> 1 => Presence 44%
