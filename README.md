# Heart Disease Prediction Data Analysis (Excel-Based Project)

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a heart disease dataset to understand:
- Who is more at risk of heart disease  
- Which medical tests indicate early warning signs  
- Why heart attacks can sometimes occur without obvious symptoms  

The analysis is **descriptive and exploratory** in nature, aimed at understanding patterns in the data rather than building prediction models.

The dataset contains **270 patient records** with medical details such as age, gender, heart test results, exercise performance, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and chest pain types.

The entire analysis was performed using **Microsoft Excel**, utilizing pivot tables, charts, slicers, and feature engineering techniques.

##  Dataset Summary
- **Total records:** 270  
- **Male patients:** 183  
- **Female patients:** 87  
- **Original features:** 14  

###  Engineered Features
To improve clarity and analysis, additional grouped columns were created:
- Age Group  
- Blood Pressure (BP) Group  
- Cholesterol Group  
- ST Depression Group  
- Maximum Heart Rate Group  
- Other derived categorical features  

---

##  Analysis Highlights
- Males show a higher risk of severe heart disease compared to females  
- Females tend to show early warning symptoms, while males often develop serious conditions without early signs  
- Heart disease can exist even when exercise performance is good  
- Chest pain is not always present - many patients are asymptomatic  
- Medical test results (EKG, ST depression, thallium test) are more reliable indicators than symptoms alone

##  Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel  
- Pivot Tables  
- Charts & Visualizations  
- Slicers  
- Feature Engineering  

---

##  Key Takeaway
Heart disease risk depends on multiple factors such as age, gender, medical test results, and clinical indicators. Early screening and multi-factor analysis are critical, as relying on symptoms alone may lead to underdiagnosis.
